# CPSC330blogpost
This repository contains the last assignment I wrote with my assignment partner from CPSC 330. The puropse of this assignment was to write up analysis on data we had performed analysis on using different ML techniques we learned during the course. The target audience for the post was for someone who may be computer literate but not necessarily in machine learning.
